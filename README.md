# BlockChain
## Background

You have just landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.

Your first project at the company is to set up a private testnet that you and your team of developers
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

You have decided on setting up a testnet because:

There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.

Testnets allows for offline development.

## Approach

In order to set up a testnet and transact the below steps were considered.:

* Name your network

* Select proof of work 

* Add addrress and network ID

* Output json files: All files are present in the "json-files" folder

* Use Geth, a command-line tool to create nodes, initalize nodes, and conenct the node together

* Apply rules to node 01

* Apply rules to node 02

* Start mining for node 01

* Start mining for node 02

* Setup a custom network in MyCrypto

* Configure MyCrytp to get an account balance

* Confirm transaction 

* Check transaction status

* Confirmation of the transaction 

## Screenshots of each of the above steps are in a seperate folder called "SnapShots"
